Child side:
	Bluetooth just on
		Check if parent in range
	If can't see parent bluetooth
		if accelerometers show movement
			Send GPS by email/text/online server
		if can't see GPS
			Emergency message
	Magnetic localization (optional)
	High frequency sound emitter (optional)
	Arrow to parent when recalled (maybe?)
	Store parent phone #
	
Parent side:
	Estimate distance from Bluetooth
	Estimate distance from high frequency sound (optional)
	Map to show child GPS coordinate and parent coordinate
	Bluetooth trilateration protocol
		Need to figure good distance for accuracy
		Give a general angle/cone of child on map
	Recall child button
		text child to come back
	Store child phone #
	
	
Both:
	Pairing to share Bluetooth ID
	
	
General stuff:
	

Bogdan tasks:
	GPS and map
		Show point of given gps
		Show cone given cone angle and angle wrt East
	Accelerometer
Stephen tasks:
	Bluetooth and trilateration
		Output distance range, angle wrt East, direction error as angle
	Magnetic localization (maybe)
	High frequency sound
		Check power requirements
